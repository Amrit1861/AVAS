AVAS(autonomous vehicle assistance system) is the project for the development of effective automation solution for vehicles so that they can navigate roads autonomously with minimium human intervention and at the same time remaining safe for pedestrians and the vehicle occupants.
Based on YOLOv12, this program is able to carry out lane and object detection functions as well as distance estimation in the real time regime.

Features
Real-time object detection using  YOLOv12.
  Detects classes such as car, bike, person, traffic light, traffic sign.
  Distance estimation of detected objects using bounding box width.
  Lane detection using:
    Canny edge detection.
    Sobel operator
    Hough Transform.
    Region of Interest (ROI) masking.
  Real-time video input processing with OpenCV.
